Wirelessly monitor and record plant data with an ESP8266 and Arduino!

This project aimed to allow intuitive and effective monitoring of houseplants to keep them healthy and well-maintained, while using inexpensive sensors and microcontrollers. Using various sensors, such as a capcitive soil moisture, humidity, and temperature sensors, the ESP8266 wirelessly sends the data to a web-page, which dyanamically updates and stores past data in a MySQL database.
